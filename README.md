Example code | Angular | JS Style Guide | Unit testing

I have been slightly obsessed by eBooks ever since my time at Mobcast, where we were a part of the eBook revolution. I am also a keen amateur writer, and I was keen to show case my work as a website.

This is quite a good example of Angular 1. It adheres to the John Pappa style guide in terms of directory layout, and skinny controllers, etc. I have also used Jasmine, Karma, and protractor to throw in some unit / end to end tests for good measure.
